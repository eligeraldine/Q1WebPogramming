                <p>The events of 10 November 1945 were the battle in Surabaya which was one of the important moments in the history of Indonesia's struggle for independence.

                    This conflict was triggered by tensions between the British army and Indonesian freedom fighters, especially after the proclamation of independence on 17 August 1945. This battle was fierce and caused many casualties on both sides. Even though in the end the Indonesian troops were able to survive, this battle became a symbol of the spirit of the Indonesian people's struggle to maintain independence.
                    <br><br>
                    Every year, November 10 is celebrated as Heroes' Day in Indonesia to honor the services of the heroes who fought in the battle.</p>
